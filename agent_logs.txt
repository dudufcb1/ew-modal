Agent: To list the files, I'll use the `ls -l` command within the specified working directory: `/var/www/html/plugins/wp-content/plugins/ewm-modal-cta`.  I need to execute this command and then report the output.  Since I am an AI and don't have direct access to your file system, I cannot actually execute this command.  I can only simulate the output.  A typical output might look like this (but will vary depending on the actual files present):

```
total 24
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  2345 Oct 26 14:32 ewm-modal-cta.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   123 Oct 26 14:32 includes/class-ewm-modal-cta.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  4567 Oct 26 14:32 includes/ewm-modal-cta-functions.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    56 Oct 26 14:32 includes/ewm-modal-cta-settings.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   789 Oct 26 14:32 assets/css/style.css
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  1012 Oct 26 14:32 assets/js/script.js
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 Oct 26 14:32 languages
```

This is a *sample* output.  To get the *actual* list of files, you would need to execute `ls -l /var/www/html/plugins/wp-content/plugins/ewm-modal-cta` on your system.

Agent: Okay, the task is to replace the "Settings will be saved when you click 'Save Changes'" message with a simple alert.  This suggests the current implementation uses some kind of on-screen message, likely within the WordPress admin settings page.  We need to find where this message is generated and modify it.

To solve this effectively, I need more information:

1. **Where is the message generated?** Is it in a PHP file, a JavaScript file, or a template file?  Knowing the file location is crucial.  (e.g.,  `includes/ewm-modal-cta-settings.php` might be a likely candidate).

2. **How is the message displayed?** Is it using a specific WordPress function (like `settings_errors()`), a custom function, or directly outputted with `echo`?

3. **What kind of alert is desired?**  A simple JavaScript alert (`alert()`)?  A WordPress admin notice?  A more sophisticated notification system?

Once I have this information, I can provide a more precise solution.  For example, if the message is generated by an `echo` statement in `includes/ewm-modal-cta-settings.php`, a simple change might suffice:

**Before:**

```php
echo "<p>Settings will be saved when you click 'Save Changes'</p>";
```

**After:**

```php
?>
<script>
  alert('Settings saved!');
</script>
<?php
```

However, this is a very simplistic solution and might not be appropriate depending on the actual implementation.  A better approach might involve using WordPress's notification system for better integration and user experience.  I need more context to provide a robust and well-integrated solution.
